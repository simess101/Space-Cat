üíª Running the Game
Running Locally
If you want to download and run the game locally on your machine:

Download the Build:

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file containing the WebGL build files.
Run a Local Server: Since browsers restrict running WebGL content from the file system, you'll need to run a local server to play the game locally. Here are a couple of ways to do this:

Option 1: Using Python (for Windows/Mac/Linux):

Open a terminal/command prompt.
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the game files.
Run the following command:
```bash
python -m http.server
```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to play the game.
Option 2: Using Node.js and HTTP-Server:

Install Node.js from here.
Open a terminal/command prompt and install the http-server package:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```
Navigate to your game folder and run the following command:

```bash
http-server
```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.

üåê Publishing the Game
To host the game online, ensure your repository is set up for GitHub Pages:
